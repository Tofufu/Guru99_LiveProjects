### Selenium_LiveProject2_Ecommerce
Summary: Each day automated system test cases
**NOTE**: The test cases/steps were provided by Guru99 - However I found a couple of test cases where the steps were inconsistent with the flow/logic of the website

>Day2 - Automate Test Case: Verify prices are same in different pages
